# Build-A-Real-Time-Gen-AI-Image-Colorization


## Overview
This project focuses on developing a real-time Generative AI-based image colorization model. The model leverages deep learning techniques, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), to convert black-and-white images into colored images. This project is based on the lessons from the course on image colorization using Generative AI.

## Features
- Converts grayscale images to color using deep learning.
- Implements Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for image generation.
- Utilizes PyTorch for model training and inference.
- Transforms and enhances images using color space conversions.
- Provides real-time processing for image colorization.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **PyTorch**
- **Matplotlib**
- **OpenCV**
- **NumPy**
- **GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)**


## Project Setup
### **1. Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gen-ai-image-colorization.git
cd gen-ai-image-colorization
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3. Run the Model**
```sh
python colorization.py
```

## Results
The trained model effectively converts grayscale images to color images. The output is enhanced using HSV transformations and other image processing techniques.

## Future Improvements
- Improve model accuracy with more training data.
- Optimize real-time processing speed.
- Extend support for video colorization.
